    "\n",
    "One of these past statements by Trump involved whether Japan should become a nuclear-armed state.\n",
    "\"It's no small thing when he suggests that America should withdraw our military support for Japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons,\" Clinton said in her June 2, 2016, speech. \n",

    "Is Clinton correct that Trump encouraged Japan to get nuclear weapons?\n",
    "\n",
    "What Trump has said\n",
    "\n",
    "As we noted earlier, Clinton’s evidence includes interviews and comments Trump has made on the campaign trail.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Trump sat for a March 26 interview with the New York Times, he was asked directly, \"Would you object if (Japan) got their own nuclear arsenal, given the threat that they face from North Korea and China?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump responded in part, \"There’ll be a point at which we’re just not going to be able to do it anymore. Now, does that mean nuclear? It could mean nuclear. It’s a very scary nuclear world. Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation. At the same time, you know, we’re a country that doesn’t have money.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s set aside Trump’s internal inconsistency -- saying that Japan might need nuclear weapons, and then, just seconds later, saying that the world’s \"biggest problem\" is nuclear proliferation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you read his words closely, Trump didn’t quite say he was encouraging Japan to get nuclear weapons, but he did go right up to the line. He was leaving the option on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having seen Trump’s comments to the New York Times, CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked him about it in a CNN town hall in Milwaukee on March 29.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering Cooper’s question about breaking with Japan’s non-nuclear stance, Trump said, \"At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, during the town hall, Cooper gave Trump multiple opportunities to back off his suggestion that Japan may need nuclear weapons, but Trump never did. He said, in succession, \"maybe it's going to have to be time to change,\" \"at some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off,\" \"it's going to happen, anyway,\" and \"wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "When Trump touted his proposal to deliver tax cuts for all, Clinton pointed out that his tax plan would help millionaires and billionaires like himself the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two,\" Clinton said. \"Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Is Clinton right that the wealthy would benefit from Trump’s tax plan twice as much as they did under the Bush tax cuts?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Clinton campaign told us their data comes from an analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on after-tax incomes of the top 1 percent. We also looked at the share of tax relief received by the top 1 percent as a percentage of GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evidence shows Clinton is right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bush tax cuts\n",
    "\n",
    "As a refresher, the Bush tax cuts, enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003,  reduced the then-top marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent rate to 35 percent, the 36 percent rate to 33 percent, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the Bush cuts increased the after-tax income of the top 1 percent between 5.3 percent and 6.7 percent from 2004 to 2012 (tax rates for high-income earners were raised the following year).\n",
    "\n",
    "Altogether, the top 1 percent received a cut equivalent to about 0.66 percent of GDP (the Bush tax cuts were altogether 2.4 percent of GDP, while the top 1 percent received 27.5 percent of the cuts.)  \n",

    "\n",
    "Two key provisions in Trump’s latest tax plan, released September 2016, are particularly relevant to this fact-check.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, Trump would collapse the current seven tax brackets into four, reducing the current top marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent to 33 percent. (His previous tax plan called for a top marginal rate of 25 percent.)\n",
